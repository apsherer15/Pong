# Pong

This is a simple version of the game Pong. There are two players, one controlled by the W and D keys, and the other controlled by the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys.

Players attempt to prevent the moving ball from hitting the edge of the screen that is next to them. They do this by moving a paddle up and down to block the ball, sending it back towards the other player.
